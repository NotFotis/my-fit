MeFit also provides special tools for <strong>Contributors</strong>. A Contributor is basically a Trainer. They can choose to add new exercises, workouts or programs or edit some of the already existing ones. Moreover, if they think is necessary they can have an exercise, workout or program deleted for good

## Thoughts / What we learned

Working with REACT was a fresh experience for both of us so it was a good challenge and a valuable learning experience. Besides REACT itself, we felt that hosting the API (on Railway) was a good learning experience. Some more detailed thoughts from each of us bellow:

- **Tasos  and Tilemachos**:   
    I feel like my main gains are in the following areas:  
        1. Class and functional components  
        2. Manipulation of useState
        3. Manipulation of useEffect
        4. A solid understanding of Redux Technology  (properly using state and safely mutation state)
        5. Properly use of state with effect to re-render the components
        6. Higher order functions such as mapping, foreach etc   
        7. Session and local storage management  
        8. Modifying objects and prepare them as arguments for JSON.stringify()  
        9. Better understanding of the MVC architecture
        10.Useage of keycloak 
      
- **Kostas and Fotis**:   
    1. How to setup properly an api
    2. DTOs usage
    3. DTOs mapping
    4. How to implement Spring Security and Keycloak and combine them
    5. Deployment to the cloud
    6. Usage of Docker
    7. CI/CD pipelines
    8. Learn to create a Database using postgreSQL
    9. Development and Production environments differences
    10.Deployment of a full application to the web 
    




## Difficulties
1. Fetching with security
2. Redux-fetch data with redux and then using them with reducers (the biggest challenge)
3. Spring security
4. Design of the app
